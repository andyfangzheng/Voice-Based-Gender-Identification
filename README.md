# Voice-Based-Gender-Identification
Herein we apply most supervised classification models to the voice gender dataset and
identify the voice as male or female. Our work uses most common classification models such
as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest,
Boosting and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Our work involves applying pre-processing
techniques to the data, splitting the data into training and testing data, splitting training data
in validation and hyper-parameter data, applying principle component analysis (PCA) for
dimension reduction, using bootstrap to generate different data sets, and applying cross
validation techniques, finding the best tuning parameters for different models. Finally, we
apply our best model to the testing data and get accuracy which validates our results.
